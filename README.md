TensorfFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data-flow graphs. It provides an extensive suite of functions and classes that allow users to build various models from scratch. I'm following [CS20SI](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html) tutorials. Thanks, [@chiphuyen](https://github.com/chiphuyen).
